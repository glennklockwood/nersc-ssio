HOOVER
================================================================================

Hoover is the framework we will use to recover incomplete Darshan logs from
compute nodes' ramdisks and reconstruct valid Darshan logs.

It is a three-component system that uses RabbitMQ to transport and load balance
pieces of Darshan logs.  The current architectural documentation can be found
here:
